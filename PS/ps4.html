            <div class="highlight">Content</div>
            Potential content available from the site:<br/>
            Raw articles in English that are not yet translated.<br/>
            Completely or partially translated articles.<br/>
            Comments for each translation phrase or sentence.<br/>
            <br/><br/>
            As detailed in planning, we hope to provide automatic translation from English to Thai in order to  help simplify the process for the community members. They will then only need to correct the errors in automatic translation.<br/><br/>

            User model: storing names, email addresses, encrypted password, registered date, and role (admin, member).<br/>
            There are 3 variations of content:<br/>
            The raw article<br/>
            The translations<br/>
            The comments<br/><br>
            The raw articles are the original English documents created by a member.
            We also maintain the record of the source (URL) of the article, timestamp, and so on.
            The translations are the small chunks of the original article translated into Thai.
            Lastly, we also maintain the remarks from the community members regarding the quality of the translations. Each of these contents will have the associated user detail.

        We use Hakiri as a Rails security scanner. This service updates security vulnerability list quite often.
            The vulnerabilities including XSS, SQL injection, etc. Hakiri not only just checks the vulnerability in source code, it also checks Gemfile for the vulnerability for each library used in the project.
            Here’s the updated list:
        <br/><a target="_blank" href="https://hakiri.io/technologies/rails">https://hakiri.io/technologies/rails</a><br/>

        In the future development we can check the current situation of application vulnerability from the repository home page, and fix the issue according to the report:

        <br/>Since our system will only have two user roles (admin and member), we have decided to use boolean valued column to distinguish between the two roles. So, we only have User model in the system at this stage of development. Once we start working on more features of our project, we will ensure referential integrity among our models.
        <br/>
        As for the queries, they are very basic queries at the moment and are well optimized.
